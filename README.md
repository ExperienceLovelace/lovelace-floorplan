# lovelace-floorplan

Floorplan for Lovelace is here!

## Installation

### HACS
Just add the URI to HACS's as custom repository.

In the procress, kindly note down the location of the files. Normally you'll find them in the community/lovelace-floorplan-directory.

### Manual

#### 1) Download files from repo

To get started, copy the following files to the `www/floorplan` folder of your Home Assistant installation (right-click on each file to save directly to disk):

- [floorplan-card.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkozul/lovelace-floorplan/master/www/floorplan/floorplan-card.js)
- [lib/floorplan.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkozul/lovelace-floorplan/master/www/floorplan/lib/floorplan.js)
- [lib/yaml.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkozul/lovelace-floorplan/master/www/floorplan/lib/yaml.min.js)
- [lib/jquery-3.4.1.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkozul/lovelace-floorplan/master/www/floorplan/lib/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)


#### 2) Floorplan image

You'll then need an SVG file of your floorplan, and a CSS file for styling. You can use the samples provided to get started. Copy them to the `www/floorplan/examples/simple` folder of your Home Assistant installation:

- [examples/simple/simple.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkozul/lovelace-floorplan/master/www/floorplan/examples/simple/simple.svg)
- [examples/simple/simple.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkozul/lovelace-floorplan/master/www/floorplan/examples/simple/simple.css)

In the SVG file, rename the element IDs to match the entitiy IDs you have in your Home Assistant installation.

#### 3) Adding to Lovelace

Add the following to the `resources:` section of your Lovelace config.

```
resources:
  - type: module
    url: /local/floorplan/floorplan-card.js?v=1.1.14
```

You can then start adding floorplan cards to your Lovelace config. Under `entities:`, make sure to add the entity IDs which you want to use in the floorplan:

```
  - cards:
      - config:
          image: /local/floorplan/examples/simple/simple.svg?v=1.1.14
          rules:
            - entities:
                - binary_sensor.main_bedroom
                - binary_sensor.living_area
                - binary_sensor.double_garage
              states:
                - class: 'binary-sensor-off'
                  state: 'off'
                - class: 'binary-sensor-on'
                  state: 'on'
          stylesheet: /local/floorplan/examples/simple/simple.css?v=1.1.14
        title: Simple Floorplan
        type: 'custom:floorplan-card'
    icon: 'mdi:floor-plan'
    id: system
    title: Floorplan
```

Note: If you're using the Lovelace editor that is built into the user interface, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the screen and select `Configure UI`. Then click on the three dots again and select `Raw config editor`. Then you'll be able to add the resources and card described above.
